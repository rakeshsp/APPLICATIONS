10. Reference Summary (Teaching & Validation)

• Radiopaedia.org — MRI Knee (reporting template, sequence rationale, and pitfalls).
• Rybak LD et al., Radiographics 2023 — "MR Imaging of the Knee: Anatomy and Pitfalls."
• Cotten A et al., European Radiology 2024 — "Musculoskeletal MRI: Clinical and Technical Optimization."
• Fritz J et al., Insights Imaging 2016 — "Errors and Pitfalls in Musculoskeletal MRI Reporting."
• Magee T, Radiology Clinics of North America 2022 — "Optimizing MRI of the Knee for Clinical and Surgical Correlation."

11. Implementation & Formatting for Clinical Use

For PACS/RIS Integration:
• Convert each main section (e.g., Bones, Menisci, Ligaments, etc.) into structured dropdown fields or macro sections.
• Keep “Practical Tips” and “Pitfalls” as italicized gray-text comments for resident reference.
• Save two versions: 
   – **Full Teaching Version** (includes sequence rationale and pearls)
   – **Clinical Routine Version** (concise report-only template)
• Maintain standardized headers for automated indexing in reporting systems.
• Ensure consistent grading systems (Outerbridge, ICRS, KL) across reports for audit and research comparability.
